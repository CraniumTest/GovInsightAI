# README for GovInsight AI

## Overview

GovInsight AI is an innovative platform designed to leverage deep learning for governmental policy analysis and formulation. It provides comprehensive insights by integrating and analyzing vast datasets using advanced machine learning models. The primary goal is to empower governments to make evidence-based decisions with the help of data-driven insights.

## Directory Structure

- **backend**: This directory contains the backend server and scripts responsible for data integration. It includes the setup for REST APIs and processing pipelines essential for managing incoming data.

- **data**: A placeholder directory designated for storing datasets and handling various data-related operations. It is crucial for storing structured and unstructured data for analysis.

- **models**: This section is dedicated to the development and management of machine learning models. It includes model scripts and training configurations to perform predictive analytics on policy impacts.

- **nlp**: The NLP (Natural Language Processing) directory contains scripts and modules for processing textual data, extracting valuable insights from citizen feedback, and performing sentiment analysis.

- **frontend**: Houses the scripts needed for creating an interactive user interface and dashboards. These tools are essential for visualizing data analytics results clearly and effectively for end-users.
